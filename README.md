AI-assisted Detection of Neurodegenerative Speech and Cognitive Changes Related to Dementia

Our web application collects seven acoustic voice biomarkers to predict the likelihood of neurodegenerative motor speech impairment via a trained machine learning model. In addition, it provides dementia screening through AI-assisted cognitive quizzes and behavioral assessments.

While our current prototype is trained on a publicly available Parkinsonâ€™s disease dataset, this serves as a proof-of-concept for detecting neurodegenerative speech changes. Such speech impairments are also relevant to dementias like Lewy Body Dementia (DLB) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), where early detection can support clinical research and screening efforts. Future work involves integrating dementia-specific datasets to enhance accuracy and applicability for broader neurodegenerative conditions.

This tool aids neuroscientists and researchers by providing rapid, scalable screening insights, reducing the burden of late-stage diagnosis, and enabling large-scale research on cognitive and motor decline.
